# Data Generation Settings (Example 5: Medallion Architecture)
# Controls the volume of test data for demonstrating aggregation benefits.
#
# EVENT_COUNT: Number of events to generate (~60% orders, ~35% clicks, ~5% inventory)
# EVENT_DAYS:  Time span to distribute events (affects minute/hour aggregation density)
#
# Recommended configurations:
#   Quick demo:     EVENT_COUNT=500000   EVENT_DAYS=1  (~2 min generation, 31,000x reduction)
#   Standard demo:  EVENT_COUNT=1000000  EVENT_DAYS=1  (~4 min generation, 62,000x reduction)
#   Large scale:    EVENT_COUNT=5000000  EVENT_DAYS=1  (~15 min generation, dramatic perf diff)
#
# Minimum: 500000 events for meaningful aggregation demonstration
EVENT_COUNT=500000
EVENT_DAYS=1
